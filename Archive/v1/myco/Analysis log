Got myco data to work with picante package. analyses:

-PD


-NRI 
with/without abundance 
null model shuffling/richness
both appear to be mostly random. Only 3 or 4 instances where p(clustering) is under 0.05
put all results into one spreadsheet called NRI.xlsx

Phylobeta 
with/without abundance
clustering looks very much random. haven't looked through the values much yet. don't know much about what the values mean!

Phylosor
based on branch length... not so useful with our dataset

Unifrac... not sure
